## Scenario 4: Healthcare Data Analytics Platform

**Potential Benefits of Open Source**:
- **Transparency and trust**: Open code could build confidence among hospitals, doctors, and patients, especially around algorithm fairness and bias.
- **Collaborative improvements**: Researchers in medicine, data science, and ethics could audit, test, and improve the algorithms.
- **Regulatory alignment**: Some governments may soon require transparency in AI-driven healthcare tools; being open source could prepare the company for this shift.

**Potential Risks/Challenges**:
- **Competitive risk**: Other companies could reuse the algorithms to build competing platforms.
- **Patient privacy concerns**: Although anonymized data isnâ€™t in the code, openness might raise fears about data security.
- **Support and liability**: Bugs or errors in healthcare analytics could have life-or-death consequences. The company might face lawsuits if people assume the open-source version is "official."
