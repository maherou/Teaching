## Introduction to Zotero

For written work in this course, you are expected to **collect, organize, and cite sources responsibly**.  
We will use **Zotero**, a widely used, free reference management tool, to support this work.

Zotero will help you:
- Collect citations from books, articles, and websites
- Organize sources for papers and projects
- Share references with your instructor
- Generate citations and bibliographies in standard formats (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.)

This page walks you through:
1. Creating a Zotero account  
2. Creating a private Zotero group for this course  
3. Inviting your instructor to that group  

Please complete these steps **early in the semester**.

## Step 1: Create a Zotero Account

1. Go to: https://www.zotero.org
2. Click **Log In** → **Register for a free account**
3. Use an email address you check regularly.
4. Choose a professional username (this will be visible in group libraries).

**Strongly recommended:**
- Install **Zotero Desktop** (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- Install the **Zotero Connector** for your browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari)

These tools make it much easier to capture citations directly from library databases, Google Scholar, and publisher websites.

## Step 2: Create Your Course Group Library

Each student must create **their own Zotero group**.

1. While logged into Zotero, go to: https://www.zotero.org/groups
2. Click **Create a New Group**
3. Enter the group name exactly as follows:

   **CS373 – StudentLastName**

   (Replace `StudentLastName` with your own last name.)

4. Choose **Private Group**
5. Select **Members can view, only admins can edit**
6. Finish creating the group

This group will be used to share your sources with your instructor for feedback and verification.

## Step 3: Invite Your Instructor to the Group

1. Open your newly created group in Zotero
2. Go to **Group Settings** → **Members**
3. Click **Invite Members**
4. Enter the following email address exactly:

   **whistle-72-petunia@icloud.com**

5. Send the invitation

Once accepted, your instructor will be able to view the sources you add to the group.

## What to Add to Your Zotero Group

Over the course of the semester, you should add:
- Academic articles
- Books or book chapters
- Credible websites
- Any other sources you seriously considered for your work

**Notes:**
- Do not wait until the night before an assignment is due.
- Keep your Zotero group organized using folders and clear titles.
- Incomplete or sloppy citation data will count against you.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Creating a personal library instead of a group
- ❌ Naming the group incorrectly
- ❌ Forgetting to invite the instructor
- ❌ Uploading PDFs without proper citation metadata
- ❌ Treating Zotero as a last-minute task

## Why We Are Doing This

Learning to manage sources well is part of becoming a professional computer scientist.  
Zotero supports:
- Reproducibility
- Academic integrity
- Clear attribution of ideas
- Efficient collaboration

These skills matter in **research**, **industry**, and **graduate study**.

If you run into technical issues, consult Zotero’s documentation or ask questions early—do not wait until an assignment deadline.
