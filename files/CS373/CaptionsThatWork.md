# Captions That Work

### Narrative Captions for Figures in Technical Papers

### Introduction

When writing technical papers and including diagrams, charts, tables, or other figures, using a **multi-sentence, stand-alone caption** that creates a mini-story is a highly effective technique. This approach is supported by best practices in scientific communication and has proven benefits.

### What the Literature Says

1. **"Extended Captions" or "Narrative Captions":**
   - Style guides refer to this as *extended* or *narrative* captions, providing context, explanation, and even interpretation.

2. **Tufte and Visual Explanation:**
   - Edward Tufte, in *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information* and *Beautiful Evidence*, advocates for rich explanatory content integrated with visuals.

3. **Scientific Style and Format (CSE Manual):**
   - Recommends that figure legends be complete enough that readers can understand figures without the main text.

4. **Writing Science (Joshua Schimel):**
   - Advises using figure captions to *"tell the story of the figure"* with clarity and narrative.

5. **Nature & Science Journal Standards:**
   - Encourage multi-sentence legends explaining what’s shown, how it was generated, and its meaning.

### Why It Works (And Why Others Use It)

- **Enhances Skimmability:** Readers often skim papers by jumping from figure to figure.
- **Improves Accessibility:** Helps both novice and expert readers.
- **Reinforces Key Points:** Boosts retention and understanding.
- **Facilitates Repurposing:** Easier reuse in talks, reports, or education.

### Tips for Writing Strong Stand-Alone Captions

- **Start with context:** What is being shown and why?
- **Describe the method or metric:** How was the data obtained or calculated?
- **Interpret the result:** What should the reader take away?
- **Reference if needed:** Optionally tie to the main text for deeper details.

### Example: Short vs. Long Captions

### Imaginary Figure

*(Line plot showing two curves: Strain A and Strain B growth rates from 10°C to 40°C.)*

### Short Caption

> **Figure 1.** Growth rates of Strain A and Strain B at different temperatures.

### Long, Narrative Caption

> **Figure 1.** Growth rates of *Strain A* and *Strain B* across a range of temperatures from 10°C to 40°C. Data were collected in triplicate under controlled laboratory conditions. *Strain A* demonstrates optimal growth near 30°C, after which its growth rate declines sharply, likely due to heat sensitivity. In contrast, *Strain B* maintains a steadier growth rate across the entire range, suggesting greater thermal resilience. These differences highlight the importance of temperature adaptation mechanisms in bacterial survival and have implications for strain selection in industrial fermentation processes. Error bars represent standard deviation across replicates.

### Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature                    | Short Caption                  | Long Narrative Caption                         |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Provides Context            | ❌ No                         | ✅ Yes                                      |
| Describes Key Trends        | ❌ No                         | ✅ Yes                                      |
| Suggests Interpretation     | ❌ No                         | ✅ Yes                                      |
| Standalone Understanding    | ❌ Requires main text         | ✅ Reader understands figure alone         |

## Scaling the Approach by Audience Type

### 1. Journal Article

**Goal:** Detailed and precise.

**Example:**

> **Figure 1.** Growth rates of *Strain A* and *Strain B* across temperatures from 10°C to 40°C, measured in triplicate under controlled laboratory conditions. *Strain A* shows a growth peak at 30°C, declining rapidly above this temperature, suggesting a narrow thermal tolerance window. *Strain B* maintains stable growth across the full range, consistent with broad thermal adaptation mechanisms. Error bars represent standard deviation. These findings may inform the selection of strains for thermally variable industrial applications.

### 2. Technical Report

**Goal:** Comprehensive documentation.

**Example:**

> **Figure 1.** Growth profiles of bacterial strains A and B across a temperature gradient (10°C–40°C) are shown. Cultures were incubated in triplicate, with growth monitored via optical density at 600 nm. *Strain A* demonstrated maximal growth at 30°C, with significant inhibition beyond this point, consistent with mesophilic behavior. In contrast, *Strain B* exhibited constant growth, indicating broad thermal tolerance. These results suggest *Strain B* is better suited for variable-temperature bio-industrial processes. Standard deviations are depicted as error bars.

### 3. Grant Proposal

**Goal:** Highlight significance quickly.

**Example:**

> **Figure 1.** Comparison of growth rates for *Strain A* and *Strain B* reveals key differences in thermal resilience. *Strain A* thrives at 30°C but declines sharply thereafter, while *Strain B* maintains steady growth. This robustness suggests *Strain B* could enable reliable bio-production in variable temperature environments.

### 4. Conference Presentation

**Goal:** Instant comprehension.

**Example:**

> **Figure 1.** *Strain A* grows best at 30°C but declines sharply at higher temps. *Strain B* grows steadily across a wide range. *Strain B*'s thermal tolerance supports its use in variable-temperature bio-industrial processes.

### Summary Table

| Audience Type          | Key Focus                  | Caption Length    | Tone                  |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Journal Article         | Accuracy, replicability     | Medium (~4–6 sentences) | Formal, technical     |
| Technical Report        | Completeness, documentation | Long (~5–10 sentences) | Formal, readable      |
| Grant Proposal          | Significance, impact        | Medium (~3–5 sentences) | Narrative, persuasive |
| Conference Presentation | Fast comprehension          | Short (~2–3 sentences) | Crisp, conversational |

## Final Note

Good figure legends:
- Give **sufficient background** without redundancy.
- **Focus attention** on important patterns or anomalies.
- **Relate explicitly** to the research question or hypothesis.
