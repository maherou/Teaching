## Overview

40% of your course grade is determined by your "Level of Expertise" assessment score.  This score ranges from 0 - 100 points with half points.  

Your instructor will assess your level of expertise during the middle of the semester to provide preliminary feedback and progress assessment, and at the end of the semester for a final assessment used to compute your course grade.

Assessments will be done in person with the course instructor, in a two-person dialogue, without use of extensive notes.

## Assessment Questions

The following questions are used as prompts for the discussion.  They are meant to guide but not constrain the dialogue.  

1. If I gave you a minute to describe what your research is and why I should care about it, what would you say?
1. What algorithms were developed and used as part of your research?
1. Which data structures were developed and used as part of your research?
1. What are the architecture and design of the software you developed or used, or both?
1. Who are the key players in your research area, either individuals, teams, or both?  Which articles, lectures, or videos were most important to your learning?  Who would you recommend I follow to learn more about this research area?
