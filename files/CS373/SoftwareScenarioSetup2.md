## Scenario 2: SaaS Productivity Tool

**Context**:
A startup has built a project management tool with features similar to Trello or Asana. It runs both as a desktop app and a cloud service. The startup’s revenue model relies on subscription fees for premium features (analytics dashboards, unlimited integrations).

**Discussion Prompts**:
- Should the company open source the core tool but keep premium features proprietary (a “freemium open core” model)?
- Would making the tool open source attract enough users to offset potential revenue loss?
- How do open source and business strategy interact in software markets?
