## Introduction to Writing Effective (AI-assisted) Article Reviews

### What is an Article Review?
In your professional career you may be asked by a colleague to read their technical article and give feedback, or you may be part of a conference committee or journal editorial board with the responsibility to review submissions that are being considered for publication.  Your job is to provide a review that helps the author to improve their article prior to distribution or publication.

### Structure for a Good Review
A good review has three basic elements:
1. A 1 - 2 paragraph article summary: It is important to summarize your understanding of the article.  This important for two reasons: (i) the summary shows you read the article and (ii) if you misunderstood the article, your summary will make that clear.
1. A description of article strengths: What did you like about the article? Was it technically solid with sufficient breadth and depth?  Did it have a good story line?  Was the author efficient and effective with their words?
1. A description of opportunities to improve the article: How could the article be improved?  Be constructive in your language.  Transform your observation of a weakness into a positive statement of what could be done to improve it.

### AI-assisted Reviewing
Generative AI tools are exceptionally good at summarizing content, if there is a sufficient amount of similar content it has been trained on.  For our purposes, we can generally find an AI summary useful as a starting point for our own reviews, including self review of our written work.

We will use AI tools in our review process in the following ways:
1. We will use the following rubrik:
   - Breadth of topic exploration: Is there something missing in the discussion of the topic?
   - Depth of topic exploration: Demonstrates knowledge about the topic?
   - Enough words, no more: Prose expressive and efficient, free of vague, imprecise terms and jargon?
   - Story integrity: Good beginning, middle and end? Conclusions synthesize points?
1. As an author: 
   - Ask an AI tool to find strengths and opportunities for improvement in your content and story telling using the rubrik.
   - Iterate on your content to address issues the tool found and request an updated AI review.
1. As a reviewer:
   - Start your review process by asking the AI tool to:
        - Summarize the article in 1 - 2 paragraphs.
        - Provide a description of the article strengths and opportunities for improvement using the above rubrik.
   - Assess the quality of the AI review.
   - Add, subtract, and correct anything you find to be insufficient.
   - Include the AI content, your assessment, and the modified review as separate parts of your submission.
