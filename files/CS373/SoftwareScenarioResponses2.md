## Scenario 2: SaaS Productivity Tool

**Potential Benefits of Open Source**:
- **Trust and adoption**: Customers could audit the code for privacy/security, which might appeal to government and enterprise clients.
- **Community innovation**: Open-source contributors could add niche integrations (e.g., linking to lab equipment scheduling, custom APIs).
- **Marketing**: Being “open source” could be a differentiator in a crowded market.

**Potential Risks/Challenges**:
- **Revenue erosion**: Competitors could host the same software for free or a lower fee.
- **Differentiation loss**: If the code is open, the startup must compete on support, branding, and hosting convenience rather than unique features.
- **Support overhead**: Users might expect free support for bugs, increasing costs.
