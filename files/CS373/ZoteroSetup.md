## Introduction to Zotero

For written work in this course, you are expected to **collect, organize, and cite sources responsibly**.  
We will use **Zotero**, a widely used, free reference management tool, to support this work.

Zotero will help you:
- Collect citations from books, articles, and websites
- Organize sources for papers and projects
- Share references with your instructor
- Generate citations and bibliographies in standard formats (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.)
- Generate citations in BibTeX format - this is the format we will use

This page walks you through:
1. Creating a Zotero account  
2. Creating a private Zotero group for this course  
3. Inviting your instructor to that group  

Please complete these steps **early in the semester**.

---

## Step 1: Create a Zotero Account

1. Go to: https://www.zotero.org
2. Click **Log In** → **Register for a free account**
3. Use an email address you check regularly.
4. Choose a professional username (this will be visible in group libraries).

**Strongly recommended:**
- Install **Zotero Desktop** (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- Install the **Zotero Connector** for your browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari)

These tools make it much easier to capture citations directly from library databases, Google Scholar, and publisher websites.

## Step 2: Create Your Course Group Library

Each student must create **their own Zotero group**.

1. While logged into Zotero, go to: https://www.zotero.org/groups
2. Click **Create a New Group**
3. Enter the group name exactly as follows:

   **CS373 – StudentLastName**

   (Replace `StudentLastName` with your own last name.)

4. Choose **Private Group**
5. Select **Members can view, only admins can edit**
6. Finish creating the group

This group will be used to share your sources with your instructor for feedback and verification.

---

## Step 3: Invite Your Instructor to the Group

1. Open your newly created group in Zotero
2. Go to **Group Settings** → **Members**
3. Click **Invite Members**
4. Enter the following email address exactly:

   **whistle-72-petunia@icloud.com**

5. Send the invitation

Once accepted, your instructor will be able to view the sources you add to the group.

---

## What to Add to Your Zotero Group

Over the course of the semester, you should add:
- Academic articles
- Books or book chapters
- Credible websites
- Any other sources you seriously considered for your work

**Notes:**
- Do not wait until the night before an assignment is due.
- Keep your Zotero group organized using folders and clear titles.
- Incomplete or sloppy citation data will count against you.

## Collecting Citations and Exporting BibTeX

In computer science, citations are often managed using **BibTeX**, especially when writing in LaTeX, Markdown, or other technical publishing workflows. Zotero provides excellent support for collecting sources and exporting them in BibTeX format.

---

### Collecting Citations in Zotero

There are several reliable ways to add sources to Zotero:

#### 1. Using the Browser Connector (Recommended)
- Navigate to an article, book, or paper online (library database, Google Scholar, publisher site).
- Click the **Zotero Connector icon** in your browser.
- Zotero will automatically capture the citation and, when available, the PDF.
- Verify that the metadata (title, authors, year, venue) is correct.

This method works especially well for:

- Google Scholar
- ACM Digital Library
- IEEE Xplore
- Publisher sites (Springer, Elsevier, etc.)

#### 2. Adding PDFs Directly
- Drag a PDF into Zotero Desktop.
- Right-click the PDF and select **Retrieve Metadata for PDF**.
- Check the resulting citation carefully—this step is essential.

#### 3. Manual Entry (Use Sparingly)
- Click **New Item** in Zotero and choose the appropriate type (journal article, book, conference paper).
- Enter citation details by hand.
- This is useful only when automated capture fails.

---

### Keeping Citations Clean

Before exporting:
- Ensure **author names** are correct and consistently formatted.
- Check **conference or journal names** (avoid abbreviations unless standard).
- Make sure **year, title, and DOI** fields are present when available.

Clean citations save time later and prevent confusing BibTeX errors.

---

### Exporting Citations in BibTeX Format

You can export BibTeX in two common ways.

#### Option 1: Export Individual or Multiple Entries
1. Select one or more items in Zotero.
2. Right-click and choose **Export Items…**
3. Select **BibTeX** as the format.
4. Save the `.bib` file.

This is useful when preparing a bibliography for a specific paper or report.

#### Option 2: Export an Entire Collection or Group
1. Right-click the collection or group in the left panel.
2. Choose **Export Collection…**
3. Select **BibTeX**.
4. Save the `.bib` file.

This is useful for maintaining a shared or evolving bibliography.

---

### Using BibTeX in Your Writing

Once exported, the `.bib` file can be used with:
- LaTeX (`\bibliography{references}`)
- Pandoc / Markdown
- Other academic writing tools that support BibTeX

When writing, you will cite sources using BibTeX keys such as:

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ Creating a personal library instead of a group
- ❌ Naming the group incorrectly
- ❌ Forgetting to invite the instructor
- ❌ Uploading PDFs without proper citation metadata
- ❌ Treating Zotero as a last-minute task

---

## Why We Are Doing This

Learning to manage sources well is part of becoming a professional computer scientist.  
Zotero supports:
- Reproducibility
- Academic integrity
- Clear attribution of ideas
- Efficient collaboration

These skills matter in **research**, **industry**, and **graduate study**.

If you run into technical issues, consult Zotero’s documentation or ask questions early—do not wait until an assignment deadline.
