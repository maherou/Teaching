## Scenario 5: Mobile Game Engine

**Context**:
A small gaming studio has built a powerful engine for mobile devices that optimizes graphics and battery performance. It’s currently used internally to produce their hit mobile game, which generates most of their revenue. Competitors use engines like Unity or Unreal, which have licensing fees.

**Discussion Prompts**:
- Should the studio protect its engine as a competitive advantage, or open it to build a community like Unity?
- Could a hybrid model work (open source core, closed advanced features)?
- How do the economics of open source differ between “tools for developers” and “games for consumers”?
