## Scenario 1: Scientific Computing Library

**Context**:
A university research group has created a new library that dramatically speeds up solving certain types of partial differential equations (PDEs). The code was written with grant funding and is currently used internally by the group and a few collaborators.

**Discussion Prompts**:
- Should research code be treated as a public good, since taxpayers funded it?
- How should the team balance career incentives (publications, tenure) with community maintenance obligations?
- What governance structures (e.g., joining a consortium) might help?
