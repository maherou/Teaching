As part of our capstone course in computer science, each student will create their own AI usage policy. This page has some resources to help you. 

# Generative AI Tool Usage: Background

- CSBSJU does not have a specific policy to guide the use of generative AI tools.
- The use of generative AI tools falls under the general school policies for [academic honesty and misconduct](https://catalog.csbsju.edu/catalog/academic-programs-policies-regulations/rights-responsibilities/).
- In some courses, use of generative AI tools is prohibited or highly restrictive.
- In CS373, use of generative AI tools is expected up to but not beyond the expectations for academic honesty.


## Checklist for Creating Your Own Generative AI Usage Policy
1. How will you ensure transparency when using AI in your work?
2. In what situations will you avoid using AI tools entirely?
3. How will you verify the accuracy and fairness of AI-generated output?
4. What privacy and data protection practices will you follow when using AI?
5. How will you disclose AI involvement in your deliverables?
