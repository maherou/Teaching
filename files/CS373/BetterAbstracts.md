## Introduction to Better Abstracts

## How to Write an Abstract

Writing a good abstract can be challenging. The following process uses AI-assisted tools to help you quickly generate a first draft.

1.  **Upload the paper to ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude.** Start by providing your paper to an AI large language model.
2.  **Copy and paste a description of the elements of a good abstract from this website [https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/essays/abstract.html](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/essays/abstract.html) into the chat window.**  This site provides a good description of what an abstract should contain.  Using this text will help the model to follow the guidance in the text.
3.  **Ask the chat tool to generate a draft abstract for the uploaded paper using the Koopman rules.**  The goal here is to have the model create a draft that you can then improve.
4.  **Revise the draft abstract as needed.**  This is a draft so you will likely want to make changes and adjustments to the output.
5.  **Copy and paste the abstract into the LaTeX source for your paper using the `\begin{abstract} ... \end{abstract}` LaTeX environment.** Add the abstract to your paper.
6. **(Optional) Ask the chat tool to generate several accurate and pithy title options for your paper and presentation.**
