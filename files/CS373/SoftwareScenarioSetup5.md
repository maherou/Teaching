# Open Source Software Product Scenarios

This document provides five scenarios that can be used to discuss the pros and cons of making software products open source. Each scenario includes context, potential benefits, risks/challenges, and discussion prompts.

## Scenario 1: Scientific Computing Library

**Context**:
A university research group has created a new library that dramatically speeds up solving certain types of partial differential equations (PDEs). The code was written with grant funding and is currently used internally by the group and a few collaborators.

**Potential Benefits of Open Source**:
- **Reputation and citation impact**: If the library is open, it can quickly become cited in papers and widely used, boosting the careers of the researchers.
- **Community contributions**: Other groups may add support for different PDEs or optimize for new hardware (GPUs, supercomputers).
- **Integration with larger ecosystems**: Could be packaged into established scientific software stacks like E4S, PETSc, or Trilinos, increasing visibility.

**Potential Risks/Challenges**:
- **Maintenance burden**: Responding to bug reports, reviewing pull requests, and documenting code could consume significant time, detracting from research.
- **Intellectual property and commercialization**: The team has a pending patent on one of the algorithms. If the code is public, does that reduce licensing opportunities for industry?
- **Fragmentation**: A forked version maintained by another group could become more popular, leaving the original authors sidelined.

**Discussion Prompts**:
- Should research code be treated as a public good, since taxpayers funded it?
- How should the team balance career incentives (publications, tenure) with community maintenance obligations?
- What governance structures (e.g., joining a consortium) might help?

## Scenario 2: SaaS Productivity Tool

**Context**:
A startup has built a project management tool with features similar to Trello or Asana. It runs both as a desktop app and a cloud service. The startup’s revenue model relies on subscription fees for premium features (analytics dashboards, unlimited integrations).

**Potential Benefits of Open Source**:
- **Trust and adoption**: Customers could audit the code for privacy/security, which might appeal to government and enterprise clients.
- **Community innovation**: Open-source contributors could add niche integrations (e.g., linking to lab equipment scheduling, custom APIs).
- **Marketing**: Being “open source” could be a differentiator in a crowded market.

**Potential Risks/Challenges**:
- **Revenue erosion**: Competitors could host the same software for free or a lower fee.
- **Differentiation loss**: If the code is open, the startup must compete on support, branding, and hosting convenience rather than unique features.
- **Support overhead**: Users might expect free support for bugs, increasing costs.

**Discussion Prompts**:
- Should the company open source the core tool but keep premium features proprietary (a “freemium open core” model)?
- Would making the tool open source attract enough users to offset potential revenue loss?
- How do open source and business strategy interact in software markets?

## Scenario 3: Machine Learning Infrastructure Framework

**Context**:
A mid-sized tech company has developed a distributed training framework that makes training large language models more efficient across GPUs and multi-node clusters. It’s faster and more scalable than existing tools like Horovod. Currently, it’s only used internally and with a few paying enterprise customers.

**Potential Benefits of Open Source**:
- **Ecosystem adoption**: If widely adopted, it could become a de facto standard, with hardware vendors optimizing their drivers for it.
- **Talent attraction**: Top engineers are often drawn to companies that maintain influential open-source projects.
- **Collaborative innovation**: External researchers may contribute features like new parallelism strategies or support for novel hardware (e.g., Cerebras, Graphcore).

**Potential Risks/Challenges**:
- **Competitive exposure**: Large cloud providers (AWS, Google, Microsoft) could integrate it into their stacks and offer it as part of their service, bypassing the company.
- **Governance and roadmap control**: Once public, direction could be influenced by big contributors, making it harder for the company to set priorities.
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Public code may be scrutinized for exploits, and the company will be pressured to patch quickly.

**Discussion Prompts**:
- Should the company prioritize market dominance (via open source) or protect competitive advantage (via proprietary licensing)?
- What models (foundation governance, dual licensing, enterprise support contracts) might help balance openness and business sustainability?
- How do community trust and competitive risk weigh against each other in fast-moving fields like AI?

## Scenario 4: Healthcare Data Analytics Platform

**Context**:
A medical software company has developed a platform that processes large amounts of patient health data (e.g., EHRs, imaging, lab results) to provide predictive analytics for hospitals. The software uses proprietary algorithms for risk prediction (e.g., readmission risk, sepsis likelihood). It is currently licensed to hospitals at a premium price.

**Potential Benefits of Open Source**:
- **Transparency and trust**: Open code could build confidence among hospitals, doctors, and patients, especially around algorithm fairness and bias.
- **Collaborative improvements**: Researchers in medicine, data science, and ethics could audit, test, and improve the algorithms.
- **Regulatory alignment**: Some governments may soon require transparency in AI-driven healthcare tools; being open source could prepare the company for this shift.

**Potential Risks/Challenges**:
- **Competitive risk**: Other companies could reuse the algorithms to build competing platforms.
- **Patient privacy concerns**: Although anonymized data isn’t in the code, openness might raise fears about data security.
- **Support and liability**: Bugs or errors in healthcare analytics could have life-or-death consequences. The company might face lawsuits if people assume the open-source version is "official."

**Discussion Prompts**:
- Should tools that influence patient health always be open for inspection?
- How does open source intersect with regulatory and ethical responsibility in medicine?
- Could the company adopt a “transparent algorithms, proprietary platform” model?

## Scenario 5: Mobile Game Engine

**Context**:
A small gaming studio has built a powerful engine for mobile devices that optimizes graphics and battery performance. It’s currently used internally to produce their hit mobile game, which generates most of their revenue. Competitors use engines like Unity or Unreal, which have licensing fees.

**Discussion Prompts**:
- Should the studio protect its engine as a competitive advantage, or open it to build a community like Unity?
- Could a hybrid model work (open source core, closed advanced features)?
- How do the economics of open source differ between “tools for developers” and “games for consumers”?
