## Scenario 5: Mobile Game Engine


**Potential Benefits of Open Source**:
- **Developer adoption**: By open sourcing, the studio could attract independent developers who want a free, optimized mobile engine.
- **Ecosystem growth**: As more developers use the engine, the studio gains credibility and influence, potentially monetizing with support, asset stores, or cloud builds.
- **Recruitment**: Open-source exposure could help attract talented game developers.

**Potential Risks/Challenges**:
- **Loss of competitive edge**: Competitors could use the engine to build games that outperform the studioâ€™s own products.
- **Monetization uncertainty**: Unlike Unity/Unreal, the studio lacks an established ecosystem to generate revenue from licensing or marketplaces.
- **Quality control**: Open contributions could dilute the vision and performance goals of the original engine.
