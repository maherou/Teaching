## Reading, Viewing, and Listening: ReVeaL

### The More Things Change
The computer science field is almost synonymous with change.  Ever-evolving, the key to long-term success in computer science is to incorporate reading, viewing, and listening as part of your daily habits.

### Regular Content Reflection Assignments
Each Friday before noon, your content reflections are due.  Periodically throughout the semester, we will spend class time discussing what you have learned from your reading, viewing and listening.  Be prepared to briefly explain your reflection and facilitate a discussion on one or more of your topics.

### Reveal Discussion Policy

During in-class discussions, we will observe the following policies:
- All questions, comments, and behavior should be conducted with respect for yourself and others.
- We will listen actively to others, allow them to finish their thoughts, and assure that everyone has an opportunity to participate in the conversation.
- All ideas are welcome.  In particular, new perspectives on a topic are encouraged.
- Our classroom is a judgment-free environment where thoughts can be shared openly.
