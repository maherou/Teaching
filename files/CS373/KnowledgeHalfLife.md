Our knowledge of things that change quickly is valuable for just a few years. In other words, half of what you know now will be obsolete or less relevant in three years. The positive statement is half of what you need to know in three years you need to learn between now and then. 

In the literature, this idea often comes up under the theme of "lifelong learning" or "continuous learning," especially in fields that evolve quickly like computer science. We sometimes hear about the idea of a "half-life of skills" in tech industry reports or in educational research, which basically says the same thing: a significant portion of what professionals know today will become outdated in just a few years, and they'll need to keep refreshing their skills to stay relevant.

There are a few well-known works and authors who have helped shape this conversation around the half-life of knowledge in tech fields.
One classic reference is Thomas Friedman's "The World Is Flat," which, while not strictly about computer science, really dives into the idea that the pace of change in global knowledge and technology is accelerating. Another influential voice is Alvin Toffler, who talked about "future shock" and the idea that people need to constantly adapt to new information.

More recently, you might look into anything by Andrew Ng, who often talks about continuous learning in the AI space, or books like "The Half-Life of Facts" by Samuel Arbesman, which is a bit broader but still very relevant. It discusses how knowledge changes over time in different fields.
