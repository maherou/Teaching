## Scenario 3: Machine Learning Infrastructure Framework

**Potential Benefits of Open Source**:
- **Ecosystem adoption**: If widely adopted, it could become a de facto standard, with hardware vendors optimizing their drivers for it.
- **Talent attraction**: Top engineers are often drawn to companies that maintain influential open-source projects.
- **Collaborative innovation**: External researchers may contribute features like new parallelism strategies or support for novel hardware (e.g., Cerebras, Graphcore).

**Potential Risks/Challenges**:
- **Competitive exposure**: Large cloud providers (AWS, Google, Microsoft) could integrate it into their stacks and offer it as part of their service, bypassing the company.
- **Governance and roadmap control**: Once public, direction could be influenced by big contributors, making it harder for the company to set priorities.
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Public code may be scrutinized for exploits, and the company will be pressured to patch quickly.
