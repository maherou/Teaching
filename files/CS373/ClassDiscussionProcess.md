## General Process for Class Discussions

### Overview

Participation in class discussions is expected and part of your course grade. If you have challenges in this setting, please let the instructor know.

### Process

Throughout the course, we will conduct classroom discussions on a variety of topics.  The general flow will be:
1. Come to class prepared: Complete the assignment (Reveal and other assignments).
1. Participate in small-group discussions: Contibute by speaking and actively listening.
1. Report small-group highlights to the whole class: Each student is encouraged to report for the group, as opportunities arise throughout semester.
1. Broad whole-class discussion to identify emerging themes and synthesize key points.
